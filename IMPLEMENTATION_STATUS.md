# Implementation Status

## Summary

The hierarchical knowledge base MCP server has been successfully implemented through Phase 2 of the development plan. The system now provides a robust foundation for managing knowledge bases with hierarchical organization, category structures, and cross-referenced notes.

## Completed Features

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- **Storage Models**: Implemented KB, Category, and Note models with filesystem-based storage
- **Utilities**: Created path management and markdown processing utilities
- **Project Structure**: Set up modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Phase 2: Basic KB Management ✅
- **KB Operations**: Full CRUD operations for knowledge bases
- **Category Management**: Hierarchical category creation and management
- **Note Management**: Note creation with cross-references and metadata
- **Tool Registration**: All tools properly registered with FastMCP

## Key Improvements Over JSON-Based System

1. **No Token Limits**: Each note is stored as a separate file
2. **Hierarchical Organization**: True directory-based hierarchy for categories
3. **Better Metadata**: YAML frontmatter for rich metadata in notes
4. **Cross-References**: Built-in support for linking between notes and KBs
5. **Scalability**: Filesystem-based approach scales better with large KBs

## Migration Support

- Created migration utility to convert existing JSON KBs
- Successfully tested migration of "MCP Knowledge Base"
- Preserves all notes, tasks, and metadata during migration

## Testing

- Basic model tests: All passing
- Direct functionality tests: All passing
- Migration tests: Successfully migrated real KB

## Next Steps (Phase 3-5)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement full-text search using ripgrep
- [ ] Add knowledge relationship visualization
- [ ] Create basic graph visualizations

### Phase 4: Codebase Analysis
- [ ] Implement code scanning utilities
- [ ] Add pattern extraction
- [ ] Create documentation generation

### Phase 5: Integration
- [ ] Complete migration of all existing KBs
- [ ] Integrate with Claude Desktop
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Configuration

Default storage: `~/.hierarchical-kb/storage`
Environment variable: `HIERARCHICAL_KB_STORAGE`

## Known Issues

- MCP server integration needs to be completed for Claude Desktop
- Search functionality not yet implemented
- Visualization tools pending

## Conclusion

The hierarchical KB system is now functional and ready for use. The migration tools allow seamless transition from the old JSON-based system, and the new architecture provides significant improvements in scalability and organization.
